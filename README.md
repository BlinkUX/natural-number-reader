# Natural Number Reader

Natural Number Reader, by Blink, is a method of programmatically reading aloud long strings of digits, taking into consideration chunking and natural voice intonation. Numbers read aloud using NNR are easier to understand and memorize, when compared to those synthesized by traditional systems.

This implemenation of the method uses JavaScript (with the p5js libraries) for the sake of maximum compatibility. The result is lightweight, easily embeddable on any web page, and works equally well on Mac, Microsoft Windows, Linux, Android, or iOS.
